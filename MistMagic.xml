        <description>
            <p> Crafted by Meeko the Devious, this artifact looks like a small bendy rod of iron with googly eyes and a mouth made of  clay attached to it.</p>
            <p class="indent"> You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The clip starts talking in a high pitch tone explaining you how to open the object,(potentailly alerting nearby enemies), and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object.</p>
            <p  class="indent"> If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens. The item can be used 1 time per adventure, at dm's discretion.</p>

    <element name="Jar of Beeholding" type="Magic Item" source="Bleb March" id="ID_TUNA_HomeBrew_MAGIC_ITEM_JAR_OF_BEEHOLDING">
		<description>
			<p>This jar has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The jar can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the jar is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Bee Plane. When the jar is turned inside out, the content is spilled out, and 5d6 x items*  bees come out, hostile to the party unless a Animal Handling Check with 10 DC is passed by the perpretator. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing a <em>jar of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Bee Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Bee Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any wand put inside the bag is reduced to 1 charge. After the1 is used the wand is trandsformed automatically into a wand of bee swarm.</p>

			<p>If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky or under a black sun, it allows you to cast the animate dead spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 days have passed, unless the whitle was used in the negative energy plane.  ||Chose a part of your body. Your mouth moves there – it will return to normal once you blow the whistle.</p>
