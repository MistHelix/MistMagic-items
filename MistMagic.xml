        <description>
            <p> Crafted by Meeko the Devious, this artifact looks like a small bendy rod of iron with googly eyes and a mouth made of  clay attached to it.</p>
            <p class="indent"> You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The clip starts talking in a high pitch tone explaining you how to open the object,(potentially alerting nearby enemies), and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object.</p>
            <p  class="indent"> If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens. The item can be used 1 time per adventure, at dm's discretion.</p>

    <element name="Jar of Beeholding" type="Magic Item" source="Bleb March" id="ID_TUNA_HomeBrew_MAGIC_ITEM_JAR_OF_BEEHOLDING">
		<description>
			<p>This jar has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The jar can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the jar is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Bee Plane. When the jar is turned inside out, the content is spilled out, and 5d6 x items*  bees come out, hostile to the party unless a Animal Handling Check with 10 DC is passed by the perpretator. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing a <em>jar of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Bee Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Bee Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any wand put inside the bag is reduced to 1 charge. After the1 is used the wand is trandsformed automatically into a wand of bee swarm.</p>

			<p>If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky or under a black sun, it allows you to cast the animate dead spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you.

            <p>
            This beautiful carved egg seems to be made of filigree platinum and emeralds, but on closer inspection it is revealed to be made of tin and green glass. As an action, you can throw the egg to a target you can see up to 60ft to impose disadvantage on all concentration check until the start of their next turn. When you do so, make a wisdom save DC 8: if you fail, you feel so bad for destroying such a precious work of art that have disadvantage on concentration checks and attack rolls until the end of your next turn. The item was made by the curse masters of Feli, the city of sorcerors – it is guaranteed to increase in power with the user.

        <description>
            <p>The pair of belts seem inexplicably bound to one another. Holding one of them causes you to feel a small, clawing desire to be close to the other. While two creatures are attuned to these belts, you can generally sense the direction of the other creature wearing the belt, though not the distance. You can spend 1 minute focusing on these feelings to get a mental picture of a 10 foot radius around the other creature, as well as their emotional and physical state.</p>
<p class="indent">While two creatures are attuned to the belts and within 20 feet of each other, either creature can use a bonus action to cause a magical chain to appear between the two belts. The chain is 20feet long and solid. It has an AC of 14 and 30 points. It is immune to non magical damage.</p>
<p class="indent">While the chain is active, you can add the proficiency bonus of both creatures to attack rolls made by either creature and spell casters can add the proficiency bonus of both creatures to their spell save DC (8+p1 prof+p2 prof+spell mod). Additionally, when either creature makes an opportunity attack against a hostile creature, the other can use their reaction to move within range of the hostile creature and make an opportunity attack.</p>
<p class="indent">The chain lasts for 1 minute, or until it is destroyed or dismissed. Once the chain has been used, it cannot be used again until both creatures attuned to the belts complete a long rest.</p>

			<p>While some use power and ferocity to their advantage, others opt for fighting techniques that take advantage of their fluidity and reflexes. Finding the right angle of attack or deflection serves them better than tackling their foes head on. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you roll initiative, you can designate one creature you can see to be your dueling partner. Once per round, when you hit your dueling partner with an attack with this weapon, you gain a charge of Grace up to a maximum of 5 charges. If you hit a creature other than your dueling partner, you lose a charge of Grace that round. If your dueling partner drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action to choose a new dueling partner and reset your Grace to 0. All charges of Grace are lost if you do not attempt to attack your dueling partner for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">Grace. For each charge of Grace you currently have, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws against attacks and spells made by your dueling partner. At maximum Grace, on your turn, you can make one extra attack against your dueling partner each round.</p>
